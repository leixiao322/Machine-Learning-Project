{"name":"Machine-learning-project","tagline":"the homework of practical machine learning","body":"Course Project\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\nFirstly, I loaded the data\r\n```{r cache=TRUE}\r\ndata=read.csv(\"pml-training.csv\",header=T)\r\ntesting=read.csv(\"pml-testing.csv\",header=T)\r\n```\r\nThen I found that there are some NAs and \"\", so I decided to omit these columns. Moreover, I cut the X away.\r\n```{r cache=TRUE}\r\njudge<-is.na(data[1,])|data[1,]==\"\"\r\npredictor=data[,judge==F]\r\npredictor=predictor[,-1]\r\n```\r\nIn considering the cross-validation issue, I noticed that the data is ranked from A to E, so use createDataPartition function would cut some classes away. K-fold would also inappropriate in the same reason. So I decided to use createResample function.\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(caret)\r\nset.seed(123)\r\nresample=createResample(y=predictor$user_name,times=1,list=F)\r\nresampledata=predictor[resample,]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I fitted and predicted by the model. and the plot tree is like:\r\n```{r cache=TRUE}\r\nmodfit=train(classe~.,data=resampledata,method=\"rpart\")\r\n```\r\nThe plot tree is like:\r\n```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\r\nlibrary(rattle)\r\nfancyRpartPlot(modfit$finalModel)\r\n```\r\nAnd finally predict with testing set:\r\n```{r}\r\npredict(modfit,newdata=testing)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact I also tried bagging algorithm and rf, the result is not very good and it takes a much longer time to run. So I only write the tree model here.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
